This report was written to document the design of the Cooper Machine Co. Notchmatic tube notching machine as of the end of Fall 2014. The project was completed by five mechanical engineering students for Cooper Union's Design Elements course. We owe many thanks to Estuardo Rodas, George Sidebotham, and Stan Wei for making this project possible.
